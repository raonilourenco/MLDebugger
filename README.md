# MLDebugger [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/raonilourenco/MLDebugger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/raonilourenco/MLDebugger)

MLDebugger is a framework for finding root causes of errors in machine learning pipelines. For more detailed information about the framework, please refer to our DEEM paper:

* [2. How To Run](#5-how-to-run)

## 1. How To Build

To install latest development version:

    $ pip install -e .
    
## 2. How to Run

To run our example with a machine learning pipeline written in VisTrail, first you need to start a worker:

    $ worker &

Then run the executable passing the pipeline path and property-value search space:

    $ mldebugger examples/classification_pipeline.vt examples/params.json

More detailed documentation is coming soon.
